So, it seems that [Robby](http://www.robbyonrails.com/) has posted a list of everyone going to RailsConf on the Argon Express. Should be lots of fun.

Just wanted to bring up, though, that as soon as [Mephisto](http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/) gets an actual release that's more stable than Typo, I'm going to be switching over. This means that my feed URL is probably going to change (though I'll see what I can do about redirecting it), so if my site happens to look dead, just come back and grab the fresh URL.

Now, I don't have anything major against Typo, it's just that I only really want the basics out of it, and when I get random crash errors trying to update my Sidebar, I get this urge to find something else. Mephisto might be it.

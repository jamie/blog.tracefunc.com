title:  Hello, Mephisto
tags:   [blog]

Well, I've got Mephisto up and running now, so we'll leave it as is for the time being.

I'm going to see if I can port over the Typo template I was using, because I do like it, and if that's successful I'll post it here.

I have a few post ideas floating around in my head (and bits of them are on my laptop), so we'll see how long it takes them to mature into full-blown posts.

Now, if only I could figure out how to get the Save as Draft checkbox to work :P

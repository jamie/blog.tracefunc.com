Two quick notes for today.

First, come back Monday for a decent summary of the current state of the Rails 1.1 -> 1.2 upgrade situation. Summary: Pain.

Second, I'm conceding a temporary defeat to [Mauricio][]. I'm getting somewhere, I just don't know where. If I have some time on Sunday I might poke at it a bit, but I'm mostly calling it quits for today.

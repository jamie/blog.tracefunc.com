[Rplug][] has a new release up, which should now be useful for the world at large, as it has gained support for projects in subversion.

The update process now preserves the .svn turds rather than breaking the working copy, which is possible now that [SourceControl][] has taught svn (and svk) how the manifest command should be implemented (11 lines of ruby).

I should probably do a check after I've done the export and cull any now-empty directories from the plugin dir, but that'll come in time, I'm sure.

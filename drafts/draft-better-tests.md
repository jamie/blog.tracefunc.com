title:      Better Tests
tags:       [programming, testing]

- Yehuda's talk at RubyConf
- more emphasis on acceptance tests/public API tests
- since those give better confidence and more "business value"
- unit tests still good and important
- difference is unit tests useful for developers, whereas acceptance tests are useful for developers (refactoring) *and* users (other developers, end users)

My name's Jamie Macey. I'm a senior software engineer with almost 15 years experience in the Ruby and Rails ecosystems, largely on the back-end. For more details, see my [resume](/static/jamie-macey/).

Husband, father, gamer, and all-around geek. Ask about my latest 3d print, or toy software project.

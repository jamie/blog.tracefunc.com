title:  RejectConf Talk - RCov Hack
tags:   [programming, ruby, rails]

It seems that there were people making both [audio][] and [video][] recordings of talks at RejectConf this year.

I gave a short talk on the RCov hack I've been working on (mentioned [previously][]) which seemed to go well. The quality of the video isn't that great, but Geoff's recording of just the audio is good. It should go along well with [the slides][] (pdf) if anyone's curious.

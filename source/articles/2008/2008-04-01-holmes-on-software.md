title:  Holmes on... software?
tags:   [programming, holmes]

HGTV in Canada produces a tv show called [Holmes on Homes][] that follows general contractor Mike Holmes as he visits failed renovations, provides commentary on the sorry situation of the work done, and then goes about fixing them.

I was recommended to the series by a friend of mine, who has suggested that the shows and situations very often have a correlation to the world of software development.  After seeing the first four episodes, I decided he was right, that all the episodes I've seen have direct quotes that are applicable, and that I should start blogging them.

So, consider this the "front page" article on this, I'll fill in the individual episode links as I get around to them.  The list of episodes is just the ones I have available to watch (on [DVD][] or from [HGTV][]) at the moment.

So I've gone and switched up blogging platforms again. This time, it's [Jekyll][]. It's not that I had any problems with [webby][], just thought I'd try it out. After spending a few hours porting things over (mostly layout and helpers, my posts are already in [markdown][]) I think I'm going to stick with it.

[webby]: http://github.com/TwP/webby/
[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

Being blog-aware is looking like a huge win - if I'm ok with my posts just being recorded by date, rather than date+time, there's a lot less overhead that needs to get done to push a new post up. I have smaller YAML preambles, and the only custom code I'm maintaining is some custom Liquid filters. With less time being spent worrying about the blog software, I might be more successful at the whole blog-writing bit. Maybe.

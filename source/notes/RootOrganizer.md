# RootOrganizer

Organizing some 3d printed trays for [Root](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/237182/root) to fit both expansions in the main box.

### Measurements

Core box internals are 275x200mm, ~66mm depth. With the Otter card offer off on the long side of the box (sadly won't fit across a short edge, I'm totally considering trimming it a few mm), I can fit two rows of 95mm trays.

As to depth, faction boards/rules 20mm, single map 17mm, and 25mm-deep trays will actually fit everything inside.

### Tray Sizing

* Baseline 95mm long, 25mm deep, varying width as follows:
    * Cats - 60mm *
    * Birds - 40mm
    * Mice - 35mm
    * Vagabond - 40mm, better if bigger + has more dividers, also needs 8.5mm of cards
    * Lizard - 55mm
    * Otter - 35mm
    * Crow - 35mm
    * Mole - 55mm (or 70mm incl. cards, 27mm height) (5.5mm of cards)
    * Resin Clearing Markers - 90mm max
    * Exile Deck + Eyrie + Faction Overviews - 70mm
    * Dice
    * Shop Items
    * Tower/Raft
    * Tunnels - 102mm, awkward.
    * Alt. Exile Deck - 70mm
* Layout (275mm width x 2 rows of 95mm):
    * 275mm: Exile Deck, Cats, Birds, Mice, Otter, Crow
    * 270mm: Vagabond+Cards, Lizard, Mole, Clearing
        * Maybe could bump clearing another 5mm and squeeze in dice/shop around them? Also possible to flex on height? Still leaves tower/raft unaccounted for, and tunnels with nowhere to live.
        * Tunnels sideways need 30.2mm (so 31mm total height on trays) which would free up a lot of space restrictions. 35mm height would I think let us get clearing markers vertically. Yellow/red fit a 55mm tray but want a 45/50mm subdivision. Orange with a 35/60mm subdivision leaves plenty of room for dice/shop/tower/raft. That only bumps up overall width from current resin measure +20mm. Tunnels still an awkward item for inside a tray.

### WIP TODOS

- Print alternate trays at 35mm height, re-measure factions?
- Figure out where subdivisions make sense inside trays? Separate the warriors/tokens maybe?
- Measure up what impact we'd have putting the tunnel tokens alongside the edge of the box, beside the Otter's card holder, if we need to shrink tray lengths.

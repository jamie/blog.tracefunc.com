# Ruby Upgrade Notes

### Ruby 2.7

There's a [big thread](https://discuss.rubyonrails.org/t/new-2-7-3-0-keyword-argument-pain-point/74980) talking about the [[Ruby]] 2.7/3.0 upgrade path, includes some good ideas for managing the warning storm related to kwargs (see especially Florent's post, warning.rb to squelch prod/dev log output, and Deprecation Toolkit to keep a to-do list both look handy).

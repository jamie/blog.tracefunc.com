# ActiveRecord Models Diagramming

- [Rails ERD](https://github.com/voormedia/rails-erd) generates a graphviz diagram of all your models, but on large apps is far too noisy to be particularly useful.

- https://blog.saeloun.com/2023/07/18/sort-your-rails-models/ has a script that works through your models via reflection, if you want some custom analysis.

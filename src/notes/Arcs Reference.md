## Campaign

- Do not end Acts early, ignore victory thresholds on power track.
- (Act 1-2) Fate has an Objective, and tells you how to advance (down) your objective token.
- Between Acts there's an intermission, which gives a bonus for completing your objective. You might choose a new Fate.
- (Act 3) "A" and "B" Fates give two Grand Ambitions, which grant more power at the end of each chapter as marked - lower value fulfilling one, higher value fulfilling both.
- (Act 3) "C" Fates have a Final Objective, ***you win the game*** at end of a chapter if you complete it and have at least 1 Power.
	- You can still win by simply having the most power.

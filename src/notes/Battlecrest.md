# Battlecrest

> _Shots ring out in the overgrown forest. A rugged pirate, festooned with weapons of war, stomps into view. He scans the nearby treeline with practiced rigor. In the gnarled canopy above, a celestial goddess calls for an ancestral blessing. With a divine roar she drops to the ground below, swinging her ornate staff with the strength of a thousand lifetimes at her waiting target..._

Battlecrest is a big game of heroic, tactical combat that is very portable, and quick to set up and play.

This 18-card Base Game includes two Hero Sets and one Map Set; everything you need to play with two players. All Battlecrest Hero and Map Sets are designed to work together, allowing for a highly expandable and customizable experience.

## COMPONENTS
Fellwoods Map Set (6 Landmark Cards)
Akhena Hero Set (1 Hero, 1 Health, 4 Action Cards)
Mutiny Hero Set (1 Hero, 1 Health, 1 Minion, 3 Action Cards)
Akhena and Mutiny Al Sheets (for solo play, requires Imperator expansion)

## KEY CONCEPTS
Warriors: Warriors are the characters controlled by the players. The main warriors are Heroes. Some Heroes have secondary warriors, called Minions
Allies vs Enemies: For each player, allies are the warriors controlled by that player and enemies are the warriors controlled by an opponent.
Active/exhausted/primed: Action Cards are active when vertically oriented, and become exhausted when rotated 90° clockwise. Exhausting a card will prime its crest (see Ability Modifiers).
Adjacent: A card is adjacent to another card if they are touching side-to-side (orthogonally) or touching corner-to-corner (diagonally).
Flip Icon (7): This card is immediately flipped over as part of resolving the effect.

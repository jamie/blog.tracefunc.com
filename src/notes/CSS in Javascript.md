# CSS in Javascript

- [Styled JSX](https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx) - gives reasonable style tags like Vue, scoped to just the current component. Unlike styled-components, you donâ€™t need to define specifically-wrapped elements.
- [Styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/)styled-components is probably the community forerunner, 26k stars
- Alternately, write less CSS with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com). See a [good use of components](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/extracting-components) in docs.

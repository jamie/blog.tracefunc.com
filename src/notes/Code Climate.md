# Code Climate

Provides a [commandline tool](https://github.com/codeclimate/codeclimate) + docker images to run locally, but also host it (imo expensive) [as a commercial service](https://codeclimate.com/) with pretty reporting and github hooks.

Can run a bunch of linters for various languages, as well as things like bundler-audit, and higher-level analyses to measure code complexity vs churn.

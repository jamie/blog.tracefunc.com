# Competitive Programming

- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is a daily challenge during September, with time-based leaderboards. Usually only 2-3 that wind up taking more than an hour, and the early problems should be approachable to almost anyone.
- [ICFP Contest](https://www.icfpconference.org/contest.html) is an annual weekend event typically in July/August. Expect to be wokring on the problem space full time, all weekend.
- [Synacor Challenge](https://challenge.synacor.com/) by the guy behind Advent of Code, I haven't done this yet.

# Fonts for Code

Currently in VSCode I am using: `Iosesvka, VictorMono Nerd Font, Victor Mono, FiraCode Nerd Font, Fira Code, Menlo, Monaco, 'Courier New', monospace`

- [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) I'm looking into, it's very customizable 
- [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/) is my current default
- [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode) also a reliable standby
- ([Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) variants are patched to include a bunch of misc icons)

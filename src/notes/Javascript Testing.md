# Javascript Testing

(In order of popularity by npm downloads)

- [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) - snapshot large objects, parallel testing, code coverage, mocks.
- [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) - browser support, async support, parallel testing, code coverage
- [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html) - real browser or headless PhantomJS, just a runner so use it with Jasmine, Mocha, etc.

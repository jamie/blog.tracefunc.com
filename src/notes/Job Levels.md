# Job Levels

Buffer is exceptionally open about their salaries (the whole company has salaries posted publicly). They've shared blog posts about their [2019 change to their compensation formula](https://buffer.com/resources/salary-formula-changes-2019/) and also a nice post about [career paths](https://buffer.com/resources/career-framework/) and what that looks like between makers & Managers.

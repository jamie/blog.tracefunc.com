# Job Search

When assessing a potential employer, [the Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/) is a set of quick yes/no questions to check the technical maturity of their engineering team. 11-12 is great, 10 and under is worrying. Given that it's 20 years old, consider [the Pragmatic Engineer Test](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/pragmatic-engineer-test/) that considers both technical and organizational aspects. Again, aim for 11-12. (NB: the author of the latter also has a [job board](https://pragmatic-engineer.pallet.com/jobs))

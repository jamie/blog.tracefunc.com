# Mentoring

## A Mentoring cycle

Via [The Coaching Habit: 7 Great Questions](https://www.amazon.ca/Coaching-Habit-Less-Change-Forever/dp/0978440749)

1: The Kickstart Question – What’s on your mind?
This is how we begin our conversations in a way that is focused and open.

2: The AWE Question – And what else?
Asking this question, “And what else?” works as a self-management tool for us as the coach and as a boost for the other six questions.

3: The Focus Question – What’s the real challenge here for you?
As the question implies, this question begins to funnel the topic in a way that focuses the conversation.  It works in conjunction with the next question.

4: The Foundation Question – What do you want?
This question takes us to the heart of the matter so that our attention is on what really matters.

5: The Lazy Question – How can I help?
By asking this question, we learn what the person wants our role to be. (e.g., listener, supporter, encourager, etc.)

6: The Strategic Question – If you are saying Yes to this, what are you saying No to?
Saying YES more slowly means being willing to stay curious before committing.

7: The Learning Question – What was most useful for you?
The Learning Question pairs with the Kickstart Question to make what Stanier calls the Coaching Bookends – ensuring conversations with you are of high value.

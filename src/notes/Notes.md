# Notes

My current go-to (that powers this part of the blog) is [Notable](https://notable.app/). Mac, desktop, just notes + tags.

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is similar, but a bit more featureful (backlinks, link map, etc).

[Zettlr](https://www.zettlr.com/) is more multi-use (multiple notebooks) and does some weird near-wysiwyg formatting.

[Foam](https://github.com/foambubble/foam) is an extension for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and looks about as featureful as Obsidian. Includes publishing tools, but I'd rather have some custom translations to embed more cleanly in the blog.

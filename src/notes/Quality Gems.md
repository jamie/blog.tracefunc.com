# Quality Gems

TODO: Make a blog post out of this.

A shout-out to some gems/tools that have a well-deserved place in my [[Rails]] toolbox.
–	Pagy (ActiveRecord pagination, focused on performance)
–	Pry (debugger)
–	Rbspy (sampling profiler) [Rust]
–	rack-mini-profiler, flamegraph, stackprof, memory_profiler (performance analysis tooling) (reference https://samsaffron.com/archive/2013/03/19/flame-graphs-in-ruby-miniprofiler for custom instrumentation)
–	rubocop / rufo
–	Hamlit
–	Cells
–	d3js (chart-buildling library) [JS]
–	sidekiq
–	Bullet (detects N+1 queries)
–	Insomnia (HTTP api tool)

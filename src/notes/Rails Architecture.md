# Rails Architecture

Notes from 37 signals:

- [Vanilla Rails Stack](https://dev.37signals.com/a-vanilla-rails-stack-is-plenty/) with as few additional gems / JS packages as possible.
- [Vanilla Rails](https://dev.37signals.com/vanilla-rails-is-plenty/) talks about how they structure controller actions & models, and leverage concerns effectively. No "service" objects, make a richer model layer!

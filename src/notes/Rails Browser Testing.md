# Rails Browser Testing

Via Evil Martians:
- [Part 1](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/system-of-a-test-setting-up-end-to-end-rails-testing) setting up Ferrum and Cuprite, in Docker
- [Part 2](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/system-of-a-test-2-robust-rails-browser-testing-with-siteprism) setting up SitePrism to decouple specs from the specifics of HTML, using some adapter classes

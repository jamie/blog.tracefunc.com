# Rails Performance Notes

> Notes reading [Complete Guide to Rails Performance](https://www.railsspeed.com/) by Nate Berkopec

### Cheat Sheet

From "The Easy Mode Stack" - Nate's defaults until you outgrow them or acquire special needs.

- CDN: Cloudflare
- JS: HTML-over-the-wire
- Webserver: Nginx
- App server: Puma
- Host: Heroku
- Webfonts: Google Fonts
- Web Framework: Rails
- HTTP Library: Typhoeus
- Database: Postgres
- DB Vendor: Whatever's closest to you
- Cache Backend: Redis
- Background Jobs: Sidekiq
- Performance Monitoring: New Relic
- Performance Testing: siege, ab, wrk
- Realtime Framework: message_bus (ActionCable still difficult to scale)
- User Auth: has_secure_password (builtin! Devise not necessary, but use it if you need OAuth)
- Ruby: MRI (CRuby)
- Views: erb, or Haml via hamlit

# An Alternate Take

[Some advice from Pawe≈Ç Urbanek](https://pawelurbanek.com/optimize-rails-performance), who does performance consulting. Post also includes links to more articles.

- Frontend: HTTP caching headers, HTTP2, Cloudflare
- ScoutAPM for drilling down to backend bottlenecks
- Redundant (N+1) SQL [ed: use Scout or Bullet gem]
- Unoptimized SQL: rails-pg-extras gem to dig into analysis, start with `outliers` and `long_running_queries`. See also pgMustard.
- DB Layer Config: AWS RDS provides a lot of visibility
- Server config: Puma for threadsafe. If AWS, always use newest generation (ie, prefer m5.large to m4.large)

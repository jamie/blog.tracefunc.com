# Rails Service Objects

There's lots of options for service objects to house business logic outside controllers (because bloat) and models (because of cross-model concerns).

- [This post on contexts](https://nts.strzibny.name/business-logic-in-rails-with-contexts/) applies a concept from [Phoenix](https://www.phoenixframework.org/) 
- [This post presenting Operators](https://petr.codes/blog/rails/business-logic-with-operators/) as a lightweight PORO solution seems pretty reasonable. (It was written in response to the previous)

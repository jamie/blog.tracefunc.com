# Rails System Testing

- Blog post arguing for [CDP, Ferrum, and Cuprite](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/system-of-a-test-setting-up-end-to-end-rails-testing) which provides a pure [[Ruby]] Capybara driver talking to Chrome.
- [Running system tests with Playwright](https://justin.searls.co/posts/running-rails-system-tests-with-playwright-instead-of-selenium/) leads to more reliable tests than Selenium as it's more aware of JS runtime execution, no need to wait arbitrary times for the browser to "settle".

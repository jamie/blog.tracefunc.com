# Static Site Generators

I currently use [[Middleman]].

I'm keeping an eye on [Bridgetown](https://www.bridgetownrb.com/) which is still a Ruby base for static content (it started as a fork of Jekyll), but is modern-javascript-aware. There's a pipeline ready to go if you want to integrate [[React]]/[[VueJS]]/[[Stimulus JS]] components or CSS frameworks like Bulma/[[Tailwind]] that benefit from a build/purge step.

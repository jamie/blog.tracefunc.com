# Web Hosting

Specifically with an eye for Bridgetown static sites and/or small Rails apps.

- [Render](https://render.com/) - Static hosting, Node/Python/Go/Rust/Ruby/Elixir apps, Postgres, Redis, cron. Everything but cron has a $0 base tier. TLS support, CDN.
- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) - Static hosting, serverless functions, form submissions. Baseline pricing by "member" feels weird though.
- [Fly](https://fly.io/) - Run anything in a Dockerfile, deploys to multiple geo locations for fast reads, manages a distributed Postgres cluster across those deploy locations.

# fzf

[`fzf`](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) is an incremental search tool for the terminal.

Here's a [good summary](https://medium.com/@vdeantoni/boost-your-command-line-productivity-with-fuzzy-finder-985aa162ba5d) of setup and usage. Just out of the gate, adding it to zsh and knowing that you can type and hit ctrl+r to match is good enough to get rolling.

[`fzf-tab`](https://github.com/Aloxaf/fzf-tab) replaces the zsh default tab completion to just naively run through fzf, it's also great.

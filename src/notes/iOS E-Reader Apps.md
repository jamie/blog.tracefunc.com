# iOS E-Reader Apps

All below:
- OPDS browser with multi-download support
- Reader w/ Bookmarks, Search, Annotations/Highlights

## Yomu

- Library
  - Manual archive, tags; auto-collections via file format or author
  - No Series support, no tag sync when importing from OPDS
- Reader
  - Bottom progress bar breaks up progress per chapter, emphasizes current chapter, shows rough progress through chapter
  - Justified text + auto-hyphenation + small margins make for a pleasant read.

## MapleRead

- OPDS Browser
- Library
  - Manual "Sets" for books (maybe useful for keeping tech books and novels separate?)
  - OPDS import includes Series and Tag info for filtering
  - Allows sorting by series, and when in "Author" or "Series" sorts indicates the series number
- Reader
  - Very busy header bar
  - Very fine font size adjustment (with amazing pinch-to-zoom to set it)
  - Vocab
  - Anchor (mark current place for easy return if back-referencing)

## Marvin

- OPDS Browser
- Library
  - Imports with series, tags, but frustratingly not number-in-series
- Reader
  - Awkward settings overlays
  - Deep View (The latter does text analysis for frequent proper nouns, I think by capitalization, which is an amazing quick reference back to when characters are introduced)
  - Image Viewer (pan/zoom on a dedicated view)

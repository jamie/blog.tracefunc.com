### Open Source

Minor projects, either small libraries or side projects that lack sufficient
polish to be fit for general use.

- [epub](http://github.com/jamie/epub), a partial epub library and stanza catalog server
- [campfirc](http://github.com/jamie/campfirc), a campfire-irc bridge
- [webbylog](http://github.com/jamie/webbylog), a blog template for [webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/). Functional, though I've since switched to [toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto).
- [user_agent](http://github.com/jamie/user_agent), a simple server-side user agent parser

### Problems / Competitions

Competitions, or just random problem sets.

- [SICP problems](http://github.com/jamie/sicp) in Clojure, intending to solve in Racket as well.
- [puzzlebook](http://github.com/jamie/puzzlebook) solves some puzzles from PennyPress books.
- [ICFP Contest](http://www.icfpconference.org/contest.html) After working on problem sets in the past, I finally competed live with some friends in 2015.
- [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), now an annual tradition.

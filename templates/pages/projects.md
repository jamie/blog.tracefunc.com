title: Projects

### Major


### Minor

Minor projects are either small libraries, or side projects that lack sufficient
polish to be fit for general use.

- [epub](http://github.com/jamie/epub), a partial epub library and stanza catalog server
- [campfirc](http://github.com/jamie/campfirc), a campfire-irc bridge
- [webbylog](http://github.com/jamie/webbylog), a blog template for [webby](http://webby.rubyforge.org/). Functional, though I've since switched to [toto](http://github.com/cloudhead/toto).
- [user_agent](http://github.com/jamie/user_agent), a simple server-side user agent parser


### Patches

I have had patches accepted into the following open source projects.

- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
- [vlad](http://blog.zenspider.com/2009/03/vlad-version-130-has-been-rele.html)
- [memcache-client](http://github.com/mperham/memcache-client/tree/master)
- [ambethia/recaptcha](http://ambethia.com/recaptcha/)

### Problems / Competitions

Competitions, or just random problem sets.

- [SICP problems](http://github.com/jamie/sicp) in Clojure, intending to solve in Racket as well.
- [puzzlebook](http://github.com/jamie/puzzlebook) solves some puzzles from PennyPress books.
